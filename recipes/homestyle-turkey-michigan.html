    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple, down to basics recipe when it comes to the good old tom turkey.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 pound) whole turkey</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 quart warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried minced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons seasoning salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse and wash turkey. Discard the giblets, or add to pan if they are anyone's favorites.</li>
        <li>Place turkey in a Dutch oven or roasting pan. Separate the skin over the breast to make little pockets. Put 3 tablespoons of the butter on both sides between the skin and breast meat. This makes for very juicy breast meat.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the water with the bouillon. Sprinkle in the parsley and minced onion. Pour over the top of the turkey. Sprinkle seasoning salt over the turkey.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil, and bake in the preheated oven 3 1/2 to 4 hours, until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). For the last 45 minutes or so, remove the foil so the turkey will brown nicely.</li>
    </ol>
